# Welcome to My Wiki Page
Some perspectives I have on **Neuroscience**, **Mathematics**, **Machine Learning**, and other areas of interest. I like to write some small articles becase (1) to share some ideas I have and (2) it gets me to think about the connections between what I learned.

[Back to my website](https://kbian.org/)

Here are some of my notes that I will later on write them into articles: [notes](literature/notes.md)

## Neuroscience Related

The ability to be grounded, to sense, in itself is magnificent. Not discussing any of the cognitive part of the brain, just feeling the world, sensing that wind blowing against your face, listening to the drumbeat from that far ends of the road while hearing the man next to you yelling “Black berry! Strawberry!” with the words of your love ones, and seeing the sunshine shining on the people walking by, in itself, both computationally and perception wise, is amazing.

I think that the process of thoughts and cognition may be coming from something or a mechanism that we don't understand yet. But the faciliattion of how they go from thoughts to action is what we can seek to understood and such biological mechanistic insgights may help us to accomplish our goals in everyday life. Moreover, I also found neuroscience and biology to be quite amazing in how they may inspire the design of intelligent algorithms/systems and how "close" they may be to the true "structure" in nature that makes intelligence.

## Mathematics Related

I find theoretical math to be pretty fun. I think that good practical techniques that work well are derived from a theoretical root.
