# Welcome to My Wiki Page
Some perspectives I have on **Neuroscience**, **Mathematics**, **Machine Learning**, and other areas of interest.

## Neuroscience Related

Essentially, this is how I found neuroscience and biology to be quite amazing—how they may inspire the design of intelligent algorithms/systems and how "close" they may be to the true "structure" in nature that makes intelligence. I have written some articles referenced below:

- [Cognitive Neuroscience Perspectives](articles/neuroscience/cognitive_brain.md)  
  *Building a perspective on the brain.*

- [Sensory, Processing, Affective Neuroscience](articles/neuroscience/affective_neuroscience.md)  
  *From sensory to processing to perception.*

- [Reinforcing & Parallel Processing](articles/neuroscience/parralel_reinforcing.md)  
  *Reinforcing & searching: some magnificent connections between the brain and algorithms.*

- [Neural Adaptation With Cost: Systematic Balance Distortion](articles/neuroscience/systematic_deviation.md)  
  *Addiction is a systematic adaptation to deviation—a well-rounded circular circuit that feeds into itself. Once balance is distorted, problems may occur.*

- [What We Think Determines What We Can Think](articles/neuroscience/positive_psycology.md)  
  *Once the circuit forms, the rest becomes much easier.*

## Mathematics Related

I find theoretical math to be pretty fun. I think that good practical techniques that work well are derived from a theoretical root.

- [Unfolding Stochasticity Sequentially](articles/mathamatics/stochastic.md)  
  *Modeling interactions between stochasticity across time sequentially through the key representational example of Random Walk.*

- [\(N(\mu, \sigma)\) Lend It Some Confidence](articles/mathamatics/confidence.md)  
  *There are deep connections between statistics and probability, even on very basic statistics levels.*

- [All About Taylor Theory](articles/mathamatics/optimization.md)   
  *Deriving everything we want in optimization from Taylor Theory.*

- [All About Constraint Solving](articles/mathamatics/constraint.md)    
  *All problems that we want to solve can be framed as a constraint solving process. Both in math and in life.*
