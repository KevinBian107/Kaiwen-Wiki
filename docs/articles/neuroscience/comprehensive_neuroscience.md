To my best understanding, neuroscience is a very "hiearchical" field, studying various topics from (this is not meant tobe an exostive list):

- **Global** perspective of how the brain sense and interact with the enviornment (sensory neuroscience), how we process these stimulus to think imagine, feel, and maintain system balance (allostasis) by interacting with the body.
- **Local** perspectives of how these phenomenon actually occur, the neuronal & hormonal modulations, the potentiation & receptor adaptation, and the myolination & pathway selection with synaptice refinement.

...

Still under construction, but hope to incorporate the following perspective:
