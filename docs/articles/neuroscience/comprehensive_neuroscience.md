To my best understanding, neuroscience is a very "hiearchical" field, studying various topics from (this is not meant tobe an exostive list but rather just a perspective that I have on the brain):

- **Global perspective** of how the brain sense and interact with the enviornment (sensory neuroscience), how we process these stimulus to think imagine, feel, and maintain system balance (allostasis) by interacting with the body.
- **Local perspective** of how these sensation & cognitive phenomenon actually occur, the neuronal & hormonal modulations happening within the brain and across the body, the potentiation & receptor adaptation that changes the physical structure of the neurons for establishing different connectivities, and the myolination & pathway selection with synaptic refinement that connects the brain together.

This articles is derived from but not limited to the ideas I learned in UCSD Cogs 17/101A/107A/107B/107C/164 & Psyc 132.

...

Still under construction, but hope to incorporate the following perspective:
