***What we feel in the moment may not be true and what we think now may not be real.***

We have seen in previous articles describing [how our brain is so good to adapt but affording a big cost](../neuroscience/systematic_deviation.md) and [how we think determines what we can think](../neuroscience/dev_neurobio.md). Our brain can be super quickly be trapped in an ***Learned Helplessness*** mood where we simply don't see a way to go for solving the issues we face. With more and more reinforcing with more learned helplessness experiences, this anchors our brain state at such bad region, making every cues an excuse for Amygdala to take over. We can't control the environment or the source of stress, but we can build up our system to be ***biologically strong*** (mentally strong if you want to call it from a psycological perspective) where we have good enough state flexability that we can operate under any conditions. ***State Flexibility*** refers to the ability where you can switch between different ***internal brain stages*** very quickly to match the needs of the environment. It is down by jumping out of first person's perspective and ***change an view point***. When it is needed, such state flexability would use all PFC power to ***jump out*** of any personal "precived" neagtive emotions to see from a ***third person's perspective*** on your thoughts, actions, and feelings, hence, helping you to restore your senses and see what is the ***true conditions*** and what is the ***conditions that your stressor is letting you see***.

When you are outside of the environment and context that you are in, you will realize that all the problem you think matters a lot earlier actually is no longer a problem. Making decision in your emotion is never wise, but sometiems it is really hard to escape such habitual way of thinkig unless if you explictly practice to "jump out of the scene". This helps to prevent ***allostatic load*** making you ***seeing*** misleading informations, ***feeling*** inacurate emotions, or ***consolidating*** the wrong thinking process.

We tend to think to the tails of the distribution when under high allostatic load, pushing thoughts to discretized bins thta is either black or white, but this isn't usually the truth, the truth tends to be normally distributed. When you try to jump out of your havitual thinking process more, more neuroplastic effect，neuropeptide effect, and HPA effects would take place and make your mental power stronger on a physical and biological state, "*helping you see the full spectrum again*".

What you think now may not be what you actually think and what you feel now may not be what you actually feel. ***Give your body the time it need to drop all the allostatic load***, it will restore to a balance state, don't make this waiting process a consolidation of wrong thinkings. When you can, please  stop and wait a bit, step out of the picture, or ***just simply don't care about it for tonight***. No matter ho  you frame it, we will ***fake it until make it*** and  we will not be blind folded by the emotions and ideas that all aour stressors give us.
